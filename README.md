# CSE_120_Game
Simple platformer game in which you must dodge the bullets falling from the sky.
Made using Python and the Arcade module.
Credits to craftpix.net for the tileset and character sprite assets!

In order to play I reccomend downloading the project and opening it using PyCharm with the Arcade module installed in your system and using python 3.10
